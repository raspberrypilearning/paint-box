## Making a pencil

Let's start by making a pencil that can be used to draw on the stage.

+ Open the 'Paintbox' Scratch project online at [jumpto.cc/paint-go](http://jumpto.cc/paint-go){:target="_blank"} or download from <http://jumpto.cc/paint-get>{:target="_blank"} and then open it if you are using the offline editor.

You will see pencil and eraser sprites:

+ Add some code to the pencil sprite to make it follow the mouse `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} so that you can draw:

```blocks
    when flag clicked
    forever
      go to [mouse pointer v]
    end
```

+ Click the flag and then move the mouse around the stage to test whether the code works.

Next, let's make your pencil only draw `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} the mouse has been clicked.

+ Add this code to your pencil sprite:

+ Test your code again. This time, move the pencil around the stage and hold down the mouse button. Can you draw with your pencil?

## title: If you're having problems...

If your pencil seems to be drawing the line from the middle of the pencil rather than the tip, you will need to change your costume center.

The crosshair for the pencil must be placed **just below** the tip of the pencil, not on the tip of the pencil.

A changes in a sprite's 'costume center' isn't registered until another tab is clicked, so click on another costume, or on the 'Scripts' tab to finalise your changes to the costume center.
