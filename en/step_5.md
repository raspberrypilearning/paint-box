## Changing the pencil width

Let's allow the user to draw using a range of different pencil sizes.

+ First, add a new variable called `width`{:class="blockvariable"}.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

+ Add this line _inside_ the `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} loop of the pencil's code:

```blocks
	set pen size to (width)
```

The pencil width will now repeatedly be set to the value of the 'width' variable.

+ Right click on the variable display on the stage and click 'slider'.

You can now drag the slider below the variable to change its value.

+ Test your project, and see if you can modify the pencil width.

If you prefer, you can set the minimum and maximum value of 'width' that's allowed. To do this, right-click on the variable again and click 'set slider min and max'. Set the minimum and maximum values of your variable to something more sensible, like 1 and 20.

Keep testing your 'width' variable until you're happy.
